Welcome to Multi Agent Development API's documentation!
=======================================================

Welcome to our comprehensive documentation where you'll find detailed information on the Multi Agent Development API. Our primary objective is to optimize resource utilization among assigned agents to achieve maximum efficiency as well as ensure an evenly distributed task load for each agent. Recognizing that not all scenarios are the same, we have diligently tested our algorithms across a multitude of different situations. This rigorous testing and benchmarking help us to understand the performance and capabilities of each algorithm in different use cases, enabling us to identify the most suitable algorithm for each specific case. 
This documentation provides an in-depth view of our algorithms' mechanisms by listing out all the modules and submodules. It is easy-to-read for anyone looking to understand how we manage resources and tasks distribution in a complex multi-agent setting, enabling optimal outcomes under a variety of conditions.
